Stage 4/6: X-files
Description
Now, let's further modify the program and teach it to read the input data from a file.

Objectives
In this stage, your program should read data from a text file instead of the standard input. The file structure will depend on your text data type (personal information, address information, book information, and so on). See an example below:

Dwight Joseph djo@gmail.com
Rene Webb webb@gmail.com
Katie Jacobs
Erick Harrington harrington@gmail.com
Myrtle Medina
Erick Burgess
The program must process the command line argument --data followed by the name of the file with the data, for example, --data text.txt.

Note that the file should not include the total number of lines. All lines must be read only once, at the start of your program.

Output example
The lines that start with > represent the user input. Note that these symbols are not part of the input.
